# The Odin Project



Just a page to document my overall progress at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) <sub> (and also improve Markdown skills)</sub>  

--------

1. *All projects made throughout Odin are on their respective repositories of this same account (in order to submit a project, each must have its own repo).*
2. *English is a second language for me, feel free to suggest any correction.*
